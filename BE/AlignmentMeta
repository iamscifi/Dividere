"""Prizes & prices change based on how many active users choose good or evil, i.e., if there are 51% good & 49% evil players, good players will pay 1% less for everything within the game, & will earn 1% more in prizes, but only up to a 10% difference.

Neutral players are only affected when they're working for either side.

this option=the player's ID#
1: When neutral points are higher, assign this option to be a FLOAT
9: When good points are higher, assign this option to be an INT
7: When evil points are higher, assign this option to be a STR

Create an algorithm that checks player stats.
If the stat is a FLOAT, send player to N version of Dividere.
If the stat is an INT, send player to G version of Dividere.
If the stat is a STR, send player to E version of Dividere."""
